## Image Segmentation
Mini project by Tzofia Barel and Rivka McGowan guided by Dr. Moshe Amitay. We are immensely grateful for all the knowledge and personal help and guide we received throughout the year in this project. 

In this project, we worked on models how to best fit the images by the masks. We have about 650 images and masks in total. We train with 70 percent of them and we validate and test with the rest 30 percent by 15 percent respectively. We took the data from kaggle. We combined all the data to one folder of images and masks to make our job easier. You can see the links below. We started working on models using CNN and python packages such as keras tensorflow. You can see the links below for two google-collab notebooks with different models each for the project and the links to the models. The two notebooks are also uploaded amongst the files. There is also a presentation on our whole projects. You can find it amongst the file. Our google-collab notebook is based on the notebook kz-isbi-challenge notebook.

##We had to combine the images and masks to one folder each so below is the code.  
Here is the code (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-lk9EbjBBoMPo3YmKMNJYZ3duNJsa5qE?usp=sharing).
